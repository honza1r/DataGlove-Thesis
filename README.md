This repository pools all of the technical files and instructions needed to replicate the dataglove that was developed as a master thesis. The repository is split into two main sections; hardware and software. 
The hardware section contains all production files as well as the microcontroller code. 
Software contains all intructions regarding connecting the glove to a ROS network running on a computer, as well as a unity application that serves as a demo for the glove. Connection to the demo is done over bluetooth serial.
