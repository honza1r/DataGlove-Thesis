# Open Source Dataglove - Master Thesis
This repository pools all of the technical files and instructions needed to replicate the dataglove that was developed as a master thesis. The repository is split into two main sections; hardware and software. 
## Hardware
The hardware section contains all production files as well as the microcontroller code. It also contains a matlab file with some matlab code and simulink model that was used very early in the development to test and create the Madgwick fusion algorithm. 
## Software
Software contains all intructions regarding connecting the glove to a ROS network running on a computer, as well as a unity application that serves as a demo for the glove. Connection to the demo is done over bluetooth serial.
